# Lab of the extraeCourse

* Code01: It is an example based on correlation benchmark of polybench of the difference between using one or several parallel regions
* Code02: It is an example based on trmm benchmark of polybench of the difference between an imbalanced and a balanced triangular loop
* Code03 [INCOMPLETE]: It is an example based on bicg benchmark of polybench of one code with false sharing and the same one without it
* Code04: Still doesn't exist
* Code05: It is an example based on the 2mm benchmark of polybench of a matrix multiplication, and another version applying tiling (thus, with improved locality)
